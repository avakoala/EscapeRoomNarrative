<p style="text-align:center; font-size:145%;"><strong> BREAKING NEWS!</strong> The media is going wild over this current pop culture scandal. The Los Angeles police are in the middle of an ongoing investigation regarding a stolen star from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Someone removed the star in the middle of the night and left no evidence that could lead to who they are.  All the police know is that the star was taken on January eighth, and security cameras were hacked during the incident. No one saw the individual that stole the star, making this case even odder. This strange case leads authorities to believe the suspect was a fan and wanted the star for themself. Authorities are working on replacing the star, but no one can figure out whose star it was! Tourists and locals are both saddened and frustrated by this shocking event. The wanted individual left the scene without a trace, but luckily many <u> hidden messages and clues</u> were found that can lead to figuring out who the celebrity is. These hints are scattered all over LA. The first clue is in the Hollywood Walk of fame headquarters. Head there next to help find the missing star's name, so they may once again shine bright on the Hollywood Walk of fame.
